# AttendanceTracker - Backend Server

The `server` directory contains the backend server code for the AttendanceTracker application. This server is built using Python and Flask, and it provides RESTful APIs to manage attendance data. The server interacts with a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy as an ORM,
and it uses JWT for authentication.
